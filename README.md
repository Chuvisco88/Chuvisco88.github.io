# Blog

> Welcome to my repository of my blog.
This repository is based on [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down the repo
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
