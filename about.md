In the age of 7 I started to do computer stuff.
Now I am a full fledged and passionate web programmer working at [Liip](http://www.liip.ch).

Most important thing for me when solving problems is a high level of quality.

### More Information

In my spare time I like to be creative and spend my time designing, cosplaying and photography.

### Contact me

Sorry for the inconvenience, there will be a contact form in the future as I don't like to put
my email freely into the internet for all those spammers.
