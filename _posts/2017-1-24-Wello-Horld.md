title: Wello Horld!

Some time ago I started about thinking to create some space to note down my learnings
in various aspects of my life.
After some reading about github pages and jekyll, I decided to take my first step into
this world.

I'm not sure yet where my journey will lead me, but let's hope for the best and let's 
hope someone one day will benefit from my mistakes and learnings.

This blog will be mostly about web development, but I guess I'll note down other things
jumping into my mind as well.

May the force be with you.
